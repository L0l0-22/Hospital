    <h2>Weâ€™ve all heard about hormones and how they can affect our mental,
        physical and emotional health, but what are hormones? <br> 
        They are chemical messengers that travel around your bloodstream playing a major role in 
        controlling your appetite, weight, mood, sleep, stress level to name a 
        few.<br>
        They control every physiological process in the body including metabolism,
        immune system, menstrual cycle, and reproduction.<br>
        Normally, our endocrine glands produce the precise amounts of hormones 
        needed to control various processes in our bodies.<br>
        When you develop hormonal imbalances, you either have too much or too little of a certain
        hormone which can have a serious impact on your overall system.<br>
        Unfortunately, nowadays with a fast-paced modern lifestyle, this 
        balance is easily tipped.<br>
        In addition, hormone levels fluctuate throughout a lifetime and some hormones naturally decline by age.<br>
        In a nutshell, hormonal changes affect everyone throughout every stage
        of life and affect everyone differently as some people experience a 
        more dramatic decline than others.</h2><br><br>

        <h1><span>Hormonal imbalances are caused by a combination of factors such as your diet, medical history, genetics, stress level, and exposure to environmental toxins. Some of the major contributors are:</span></h1>
